\section{Augmentation of Weather Forecasts Using Real-Time Observations}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
Traditional weather models rely on predictive numerical methods initialized with historical and interpolated observations. However, their accuracy diminishes over time due to inherent uncertainties. Real-time observational data collected from reporting aircraft offer opportunities to recalibrate and augment forecasts dynamically.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
Let $\hat{x}_t$ denote the initial forecast for variable $x$ (wind speed, temperature, humidity) at time $t$, and let $y_t$ be the real-time observational measurement from an aircraft at the same location and time. The augmented forecast $x'_t$ can be formulated as:

\begin{equation}
x'_t = \hat{x}_t + K_t(y_t - \hat{x}_t)
\end{equation}

where $K_t$ is the Kalman gain, determined dynamically by:

\begin{equation}
K_t = \frac{P_t}{P_t + R}
\end{equation}

Here, $P_t$ represents the forecast error covariance, and $R$ represents the observational error covariance.

\subsection{Implementation and Application}
This method is applied sequentially whenever real-time data $y_t$ becomes available. The updated state $x'_t$ significantly reduces the error in the immediate forecast and, by extension, improves subsequent forecasts through more accurate initialization.

\subsection{Generalization to Multiple Variables}
Extending to multidimensional variables (temperature, humidity, and wind vector $\mathbf{u}$), the update step becomes:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}'_t = \hat{\mathbf{x}}_t + \mathbf{K}_t(\mathbf{y}_t - \hat{\mathbf{x}}_t)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{K}_t$ is now the Kalman gain matrix computed as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{K}_t = \mathbf{P}_t(\mathbf{P}_t + \mathbf{R})^{-1}
\end{equation}
